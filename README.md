# Erdos-Renyi

Write a program to generate an Erdӧs-Renyi (E-R) network 𝐺(𝑛,𝑝), were for at least three input configurations, i.e., three set of values for 𝑛 and 𝑝. For each configuration, calculate the following network properties and compare them with the theoretical prediction for an Erdӧs-Renyi network with the same configuration. Run each configuration at least 30 times and report the average estimates for each configuration.

- The average degree of the network.
- Average clustering coefficient of the network.
- The average path length.
- Plot the degree distribution for the three chosen configurations. Do they center on the average degree?
