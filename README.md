# Erdos-Renyi

Write a program to generate an Erdӧs-Renyi (E-R) network 𝐺(𝑛,𝑝), were for at least three input configurations, i.e., three set of values for 𝑛 and 𝑝. For each configuration, calculate the following network properties and compare them with the theoretical prediction for an Erdӧs-Renyi network with the same configuration. Run each configuration at least 30 times and report the average estimates for each configuration.

i. The average degree of the network.
ii. Average clustering coefficient of the network.
iii. The average path length.
iv. Plot the degree distribution for the three chosen configurations. Do they center on the average degree?
